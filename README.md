# VFX-Engine

A relatively generic VFX-Engine that can be used to create different types of particle effects.

It comes with many benefits:

- Reusability: You can use the same engine to create different types of particle effects in your projects.
- Performance: The engine can be optimized to handle a large number of particles efficiently and to merge multiple particle systems into a single one.
- Flexibility: You can easily customize the behavior of the particles by changing the engine's parameters.
- Ease of use: You can create complex particle effects with just a few lines of code.
- Avoid code duplication: You don't have to write the same code multiple times.
